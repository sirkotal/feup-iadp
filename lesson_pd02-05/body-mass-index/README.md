# Body Mass Index

Given the dataframe ```df``` and using the ***Pandas*** library, create a function ```solve()``` that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) using the following formula: 

```BMI = Weight /(Height)^2```

Note that ```Height``` must be expressed in meters. Create a new column *bmi* with the corresponding value (rounded to two decimal places) and print the ID, name, weight, height and BMI of the first three rows of the dataframe.
