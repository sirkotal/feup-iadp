# Maximum Age, Minimum Weight and Mean of Height

Given the dataframe ```df``` and using the ***Pandas*** library, create a function ```solve()``` 
that groups by class and gender and prints three columns: 
maximum age ```max_age```, minimum weight ```min_weight```
and the mean of the height ```mean_height```.
